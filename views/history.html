        <h2>Back on Land — Building a Sustainable Future</h2>
        <p>After over a century of industrial growth and rising emissions, we’ve reached a turning point. The choices we make today can still protect our planet for generations to come. Around the world, people are finding innovative ways to restore balance to life on land.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>🌳 <strong>Reforestation:</strong> Restoring forests and native vegetation to absorb carbon and protect wildlife.</li>
        <li>⚡ <strong>Clean Energy:</strong> Transitioning from coal and gas to renewable sources like wind, solar, and geothermal power.</li>
        <li>🏙️ <strong>Green Cities:</strong> Designing urban areas with electric transport, green roofs, and energy-efficient buildings.</li>
        <li>🚜 <strong>Sustainable Farming:</strong> Using regenerative agriculture to improve soil health and store carbon.</li>
        <li>🧠 <strong>Innovation:</strong> Developing technologies like carbon capture, recycling systems, and battery storage.</li>
        <li>🤝 <strong>Global Cooperation:</strong> Nations uniting under agreements like the Paris Accord to keep global warming below 1.5°C.</li>
