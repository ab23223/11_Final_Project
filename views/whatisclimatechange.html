        <h2>What is Climate Change?</h2>
        <p>Climate Change is a change in global or regional climate patterns, in particular a change apparent from the mid to late 20th century onwards and attributed largely to the increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide produced by the use of fossil fuels.</p>
        <p>🌡️ Global average temperature has risen by ~1.1°C in the last 100 years.</p>
        <p>🌊 Sea levels are rising due to melting ice sheets.</p>
        <p>🔥 More frequent and severe extreme weather events.</p>

        <div class="ocean-item fade-in">
        <h2>Why it matters</h2>
        <p>Climate change matters because it threatens human health, safety, and livelihoods, and negatively impacts all life on Earth.</p>
        <p>It leads to more extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and disrupted ecosystems and economies.</p>
        <p>It creates escalating challenges for populations, especially in vulnerable regions, making it essential to act now to reduce emissions and build resilience.</p>

        <h2>Truths & Myths</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">🌍 Myth: The Earth’s climate has always changed</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">❗ Fact: Climate change now is happening much faster than natural patterns and is driven mainly by human activities like burning fossil fuels and deforestation.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">❄️ Myth: Global warming isn’t real because it’s still cold</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">❗ Fact: Weather is short-term and can vary; climate is long-term. Global warming can still cause cold extremes due to shifting patterns, even if overall temperatures rise.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">🔥 Myth: Heatwaves and wildfires aren’t linked to climate change</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">❗ Fact: Climate change makes heatwaves and wildfires more frequent and intense by creating hotter, drier conditions that help fires spread.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">🇨🇳 Myth: China is mostly responsible for climate change</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">❗ Fact: Climate change is a global issue. Historically, richer Western nations have caused more emissions. China’s per-person emissions are lower than the USA’s, and it’s investing heavily in renewables.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">🌱 Myth: Plants need carbon dioxide, so more is good</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">❗ Fact: CO₂ is natural, but too much is harmful. Current levels are the highest in 3 million years, and forest loss means there’s less absorption of excess CO₂.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">🦉 Myth: Animals will adapt to climate change</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">❗ Fact: Some can adapt or migrate, but the speed of change and habitat loss mean many species can’t keep up.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">💰 Myth: Renewable energy is more expensive</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">❗ Fact: Solar and wind are now cheaper than oil, gas, or nuclear in most cases — sometimes up to 9× cheaper.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">⚡ Myth: Renewables only work when sunny or windy</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">❗ Fact: New tech stores energy and balances the electricity grid, so renewables can work even when the sun or wind are low.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">⏳ Myth: Climate change is a future problem</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">❗ Fact: Climate change is already causing food shortages, disasters, and migration. Immediate action is needed to meet 1.5°C targets and avoid worse impacts.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">🌐 Myth: Climate change is too big to solve</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">❗ Fact: Solutions exist: renewable energy, ending deforestation, and reducing emissions. Positive action improves health, biodiversity, and energy security.</div>
